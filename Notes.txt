Wut ChatGPT tells me:

If you're going to use a static XML file (like one hosted on GitHub), it must have a fixed number or you must dynamically generate the XML.

Go to Twilio Console â†’ TwiML Apps

Create a new TwiML App and point it to a dynamic endpoint (e.g., your own server that responds with generated TwiML using the To parameter)

In your SIP URI, include the To param like this:


sip:+14155552671@mysipdomain.sip.twilio.com?To=%2B14155552671
